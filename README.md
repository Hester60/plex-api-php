# WIP - Plex API PHP SDK

This is an open-source SDK designed to interact with **PlexTV** and **Plex Server**.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

⚠️ This package requires **PHP 8.3+** 

This project is still under development, but contributions are always welcome! If you're interested in helping, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## 📖 Documentation

The documentation is available here:
🔗 [PlexTV API Documentation](https://github.com/Hester60/plex-api-php/wiki/PlexTV)

## 🎯 Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on covering the **PlexTV API**.

## 🔍 Useful Resources

Here are the main resources I’m using to develop this SDK:
- [Postman Plex API Collection](https://www.postman.com/fyvekatz/m-c-s-public-workspace/overview)  
- [Plexopedia - Plex API](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/api/)  
- [Plex API Spec](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plex-api-spec?tab=readme-ov-file)  

## ❓ Why Another SDK?

There are already several Plex SDKs, but most of them are:  
❌ Buggy  
❌ Full of unnecessary, repetitive code  
❌ Auto-generated and hard to maintain  

Since these SDKs aren't community-friendly for long-term maintenance, I'm building a clean, efficient, and well-structured SDK from scratch.  

Stay tuned and feel free to contribute! 🚀
